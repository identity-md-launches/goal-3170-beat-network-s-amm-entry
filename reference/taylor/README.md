# Simple AMM: the solved game

Written 2026-11-09. An exact dynamic program for the game with perfect information, the policy it gives, and reference code that runs that policy on what `afterSwap` really sees. It is a starting point for a contract, not a contract.

All numbers are from the pure-Python replica (`replica2.py`, line by line from the engine at 6b6921f8), paired on replica seeds 10000..12047 against HA (mean 529.557 on those seeds, rows in `calib_out_2048.json`). Replica levels do not convert to board scores. Paired gaps have matched the engine so far (HA over T: 1.11 here, 1.01 to 1.15 on the engine). Nothing here has run on the Rust engine.

This replaces the reading in `../filter-brief.md`: the perfect-price table there was a search result, not a ceiling.

## Numbers

## What the solve says

- **Edge is fee revenue.** Edge = fees collected - 22.2 for every policy (22.23 and 22.16 measured at fixed 30 and 75 bps). The 22.2 is loss to price drift and no policy changes it.
- **The money is in big orders.** Half the impact revenue comes from orders above 173 Y, about 66 a run. Capping sizes at 300 Y takes 72 off fixed-30's 571 retail edge.
- **The best quotes move with the rival pool.** Undisplaced, ask/bid offsets from the true price are 29/46 bps with the rival at its low band edge, 28/28 centered, 46/29 at its high edge. Displaced 60 bps or more with the rival's bid at fair: ask fee 0, bid 2 to 26 bps above fair, so the arb unwinds the pool a step at a time for almost nothing.
- **The rival's spot is known from our own trades.** After an order that splits, both pools sit at the same marginal price: rival spot = own spot x 0.997 / (1 - own fee) on a buy, own spot x (1 - own fee) / 0.997 on a sell. Tracking it that way costs 0.19.
- **Run parameters need no adaptation.** Tables solved for each run's own order rate add +0.04. One table.
- **Price between arb pins is the whole problem.** Using the last pin naively costs 28. Under the solved policy 35% of retail trades land in a step the arb just pinned; 23% are six or more steps stale.
- **What separates +4.26 from #1 is one call:** is the first trade of a step the arb or retail. The filter is wrong 16% of the time. With the true answer the same code scores +6.98.

## The model (`dp.py`)

State at a decision: own displacement w = ln(own spot / p), rival displacement w2 = ln(rival spot / p), phase (0 just arbed, 1 after the first retail order of the step, 2 after more). Action: ask offset a = ln(ask / p) and bid offset b = ln(p / bid), with a >= w and b >= -w (fees are not negative). Quotes stay in force until our next trade, so the passive value carries them through silent steps and through orders that go only to the rival. Displacements, offsets and price moves sit on a 5 bps lattice; trades use the exact router and constant-product formulas; sizes are a 62-node lognormal. Relative value iteration, 110 sweeps, about 80 s on 14 cores.

Checks: no retail, fixed 30 bps: -3.545 (replica -3.5). Sizes capped at 300 Y, fixed 30 / 75 bps: 334.77 / 359.50 (replica 334.96 se 0.19 / 359.20 se 0.37). Solved value at midpoint parameters 536.82; the policy simulated at those parameters 536.49 se 1.03.

## The reference policy on real inputs (`real.py`, the Gaussian version)

Kept between calls: m (ln of the price estimate), v (its variance), the fees in force fb and fa, own spot after the last call sp, the last timestamp, own retail calls this step cnt, rival spot estimate s2, a flag synced. Constants: sigma = 9.45 bps a step, rho = 0.26, retail fill law lognormal with median 11.12 bps and log-sd 1.176, G = 0.997.

On each `afterSwap(isBuy, amountX, amountY, timestamp, reserveX, reserveY)`:

1. s = reserveY / reserveX. dt = timestamp - last timestamp.
2. If dt >= 1 this is the first own trade of a new step:
   - cnt = 0. No-arb interval of the quotes in force: lo = ln(sp (1 - fb)), hi = ln(sp / (1 - fa)).
   - For each of the dt - 1 steps with no own trade (cap 12): v += sigma^2, then replace (m, v) by the mean and variance of N(m, v) cut to (lo, hi).
   - v += sigma^2 for this step.
   - Arb reading: lp = ln(s (1 - fb)) if isBuy, else ln(s / (1 - fa)). If this trade is the arb, the price is exactly exp(lp).
   - L_arb = density of N(m, v) at lp. Z, mt, vt = mass, mean and variance of N(m, v) on (lo, hi). d = |ln(s / sp)|. L_ret = Z x rho x lognormal density of d.
   - pi = L_arb / (L_arb + L_ret). If pi >= 0.995: m = lp, v = 0. If pi <= 0.005: m = mt, v = vt. Otherwise the two-point mixture: m' = pi lp + (1 - pi) mt, v' = pi (lp - m')^2 + (1 - pi)(vt + (mt - m')^2).
   - The trade counts as an arb if pi > 0.5.
   - Clip s2 into [exp(m) G, exp(m) / G]. synced = false.
3. If the trade is not an arb: on isBuy, cand = s (1 - fb) / G and s2 = min(s2, cand); otherwise cand = s G / (1 - fa) and s2 = max(s2, cand). synced = true when cand replaced s2. cnt += 1, phase = 1 if cnt = 1 else 2. If it is an arb, phase = 0.
4. w = (ln s - m), R = (ln s2 - m), sd = sqrt(v), all in bps.
5. Look up offsets (a, b): bilinear in (w, R), linear between sd levels. Phase 0 uses the band table with R clipped to +-30 bps. Phases 1 and 2 use the `s` tables when synced, else the `c` tables.
6. ask fee = 1 - exp(-(a - w) 1e-4) if a > w else 0. bid fee = 1 - exp(-(b + w) 1e-4) if b > -w else 0. Store fb, fa (clamped to 0..10%), sp = s, the timestamp.

`latt.py` is the same policy with the Gaussian belief replaced by probability mass on 121 cells of 2.5 bps: each step convolves with the price-move kernel, a step with no own trade zeroes the cells where the arb would have traded, and the first trade of a step becomes a mixture of a point mass at the arb reading and the cut prior. It then feeds its mean and sd to the same tables. Worth +0.5 over the Gaussian version.

## Tables

- `pol_mid.json`: `A0 B0 A1 B1 A2 B2` are ask and bid offsets in bps from the price for phases 0, 1, 2. Rows are own displacement, w = (row - 160) x 5 bps, 321 rows. Columns are rival displacement: 13 columns from -30 to +30 bps for phase 0; 49 columns at `W2L` x 5 bps for phases 1 and 2.
- `qm_k1e-5.json`: the same offsets chosen for a price that is only known to within a spread. `S` lists the eight belief sd levels in bps. `A0c B0c` for phase 0; `A1s B1s A1c B1c A2s B2s A2c B2c` for phases 1 and 2, `s` when the rival was synced this step and `c` when its spot is the band-clipped estimate. Each is level x row x column. The file was built with an information weight (kappa = 1e-5, the third argument of `qmdp.py`) that favors quotes the arb will hit, so even level 0 differs from `pol_mid.json`, in about a quarter of the cells; built with kappa 0, level 0 equals it.

The old table scores 445.678 / 572.593 / 527.968 on those three seeds.

## Open

1. **The contract.** The tables are 8 MB of JSON and the lattice is 121 cells; the budget is 250k gas. A first port is the Gaussian filter with the six plain tables (+2.83): O(1) state, and it needs ln, exp and a normal CDF. Match `gates.py` to the digit before changing anything, then measure what coarser knots cost with the same harness.
2. **The engine.** Run the port and IA on the same fresh engine seeds and pair them. Seeds used here are replica seeds (10000..12047 holdout; 20000..20511, 30000..31999, 40000..40111, 50000..50083 for tuning and diagnostics). No engine seed was consumed.
3. **Arb or retail.** Worth 2.7. Tried, no gain: forbidding the quote zone where the two overlap (`DP_MASK`, costs 0.6 to 2.4 with perfect information and leaves the error at 13 to 15%), buying more pins with tighter quotes (kappa above 1e-5 costs more than it returns), a quote-aware fill likelihood. A table classifier on the filter's own features gets 18.8% against the lattice's 16.2%, so the error is near what those features allow. Not tried: choosing quotes against the whole lattice posterior instead of its mean and sd, per-run estimates of sigma and order rate inside the classifier, the router likelihood per price hypothesis.
4. **Finer lattice.** Offsets are on 5 bps with a parabola fit; a 2.5 bps solve is untested.
